  "about": "In 2023, I spearheaded a project to completely revamp the MailBigFile service. This involved consolidating fragmented services across multiple distributions, resulting in a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. Additionally, I modernized the underlying tech stack, enabling the introduction of new features and improved performance. \n\nRecognizing the popularity of the existing free service interface, I maintained its look and feel for a seamless user transition. To further enhance user acquisition, I streamlined the signup process by integrating it directly within the app, eliminating the need for a separate registration area.\n\nTo optimize infrastructure and cost efficiency, I leveraged a suite of AWS features including Amazon S3, API Gateway, EC2 (Spot Instances), Lambda, and Auto-Scaling. Finally, I utilized Gatsby, a React meta framework, to enable static application loading from an S3 bucket via CloudFront, for significantly faster delivery speeds.",
