  "about": "As a web developer I feel it is important, if not imperative, to have an online presence. I wanted this website to not only be a place where I could exhibit my skills and projects, but also as a personal space that reflects my personality and interests.\n\nAs a technology advocate, I like to use any new project as a means to explore new technologies. In particular, I knew this website would be static-based and wanted to use a platform that could leverage this. I also wanted a CMS as I wanted not only a blog but a centralised place to theme my website. In particular, I wanted to use a framework like Vue for the frontend as I prefer websites that function like an app, as I find the experience on these preferable to more traditional websites.\n\nAfter much research, including investigating Laravel and Jekyll, I decided to use Netlify and Netlify CMS for a number of reasons:\n\n1. It has been recommended specifically for static-based websites\n2. I wanted a headless CMS as this would give me full control over the front end.\n3. It provides continual development/deployment.\n\n\\*\\*Note:\\*\\* I should note that at the time of writing, the production variant of this website is a little bugged. This is actually an issue with Nuxt itself and it not rendering the production version correctly. I do not currently have the time nor the inclination to scour the source code for a fix and will instead await their fix.",
