  "about": "My portfolio was created to exhibit my work.\n\nIt might seem odd to include the portfolio, but I wanted to showcase the technologies that I used in its creation, as these are separate to any other project I have done.\n\nI decided to use Netlify and Netlify CMS for a number of reasons:\n\n1. I has seen it recommended for static-based websites\n2. I wanted a headless CMS.\n\n   1. While CMS' are great for editing content, I wanted more control over the front end.\n3. It promised continual development, which is just a nice to have feature.\n4. They also provide a number of useful fetaures out of the box, especially for SPA (single page applications), such as pre-rendering for SEO (although as this is using Nuxt Universal mode, that actually matters less).\n5. I wanted to try it out.",
