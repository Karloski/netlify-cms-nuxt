  "about": "Runners (working title) was a project that we started as a way to provide those who go on frequent runs or other recreational activities a means to schedule these activities with their friends and family. One of the main features we wanted to provide was a way to set out and map your run using Google Maps.\n\nI was the project lead for the Runners project and fully designed and implemented it. I was also responsible for all the server administration work, which included continual deployment using Git.\n\nThe project itself was created with Laravel and Vue using a REST API architecture. Laravel was chosen for its ability to streamline the project creation process with a language I was familiar with, and Vue was chosen for the frontend as it provides a more app like experience for web applications, which was the aim for this project.\n\nThe project has since been abandoned as it was believed that the project could not be lucrative enough given the required time investment.",
