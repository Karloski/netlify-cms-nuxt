We first built their website more than 10 years ago as a fairly standard PHP website with no framework or CMS (Content Management System). This lack of a CMS meant that whenever a change was required, they had to come to us for an update. What's more, as time went on, the website started to look and feel a little dated.\n\nTo help alleviate this issue, BSA Security and Fire and Dessol came to a decision to reinvigorate the website. This would be to both improve the presentation and performance of the website, whilst also allowing them to update it when necessary. To facilitate this, WordPress was utilised using a pre-purchased theme (Trade). New design specifications were brought to us by our designer, and I was tasked with implementing the new website with WordPress.\n\nAt this time, my personal PHP WordPress knowledge was (and, to be honest, still is) somewhat limited. While I had used WordPress in the past and had created with it, I had not really delved into WordPress' applications, especially with PHP. Given this was the case and given that the modest timescale for the project, I decided to implement the design and pages in a quicker and more straight-forward fashion.\n\nThere are many ways in which you could approach creating a website in WordPress. From my understanding, the most common technique would be to create page templates for each kind of page you would implement on a child-theme. For this particular job I was given 2 templates to work with: the home page and inner pages, with the actual website consisting of about 20 pages.\n\nOne of the main advantages of using a page template is its re-usability. Instead of rewriting the same code over and over for each page, you just plop the template you need and use the WordPress editor to modify the inner content. Something common to each page suddenly needs to change? Easy! Just modify the template and you're done.\n\nHowever, I did not do this. There were a number of factors that lead to this:\n\n1. I forgot.\n\nAnd so instead I went down a path that, while not irredeemable nor overly problematic, was not apt. Instead of creating any templates (I created none), I had to copy a template made with a page editor into each new page. This meant that if a change was required that affected similar pages, it needed to be done on each individual page. While this did not end up adding a significant number of hours to the job, it made what should be smaller changes more of a challenge. Further, the UX for our end users ended up being less intuitive when editing their pages. What's worse, this also created a situation where they could accidentally break the page through edits they make."
