We first built their website more than 10 years ago as a fairly standard PHP website with no framework or CMS (Content Management System). This lack of a CMS meant that whenever a change was required, they had to come to us for an update. What's more, as time went on, the website started to look and feel a little dated.\n\nTo help alleviate this issue, BSA Security and Fire and Dessol came to a decision to reinvigorate the website. This would be to both improve the presentation and performance of the website, whilst also allowing them to update it when necessary. To facilitate this, WordPress was utilised using a pre-purchased theme (Trade). New design specifications were brought to us by our designer, and I was tasked with implementing the new website with WordPress.\n",
