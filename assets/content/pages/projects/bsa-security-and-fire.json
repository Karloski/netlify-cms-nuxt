  "content": "BSA Security and Fire, formerly known as Borderland Security Alarms, had been a long time customer of Design Solution Ltd. We first built their website more than 10 years ago using technologies that were relevant at the time. However, as time went on, BSA Security and Fire found they had a frequent need to update their website; adding new blog posts or just general updates. As Dessol had previously created the website without an established CMS (Content Management System), this meant they had to come to us for any updates. To alleviate this issue, they wanted to integrate a CMS, such as WordPress."
