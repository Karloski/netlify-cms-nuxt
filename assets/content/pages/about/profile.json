I am always looking for opportunities to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in web development and often refer to the Technology Radar for inspiration.\n\nI﻿n my spare time I like to watch films, television shows or partake in gaming sessions with friends, usually over Discord. We often play competitive games, such as League of Legends, or play cooperative games, such as PalWorld. When I'm not playing games, I like to further hone my developer skills by researching the newest technologies. I am currently creating a website using Nextjs, which will be hosted on Vercel and built with Firebase.",
